		<h1>ALL ABOUT ME</h1>
	
 	<p>Welcome to my homepage! Well, a little bit about myself... I am currently a computer teacher instructing Kindergarten through 8th grade on basic computer functions such as typing skills and Microsoft Office.</p> 
	
	<p>I've been a teaher for the last nine years and I'm very excited to be learning something new such as coding in Rutgers University. I am very excited to be learning to become a web developer.</p>
	
	<p>I am also a huge fan of music and movies. I have a huge collection of both. On my free time I enjoy creative leisure writing, particularly writing reviews about things I have seen at your local movie theater or music festival/concerts I may have attended.</p>
	<p>Currently I am most passionate about coding. I'm still learning in small doses but my goal is to one day be able to build and create some wonderful, creative, and super interactive websites on my own or for a company.</p>
